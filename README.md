# Unicurd

Using HTML and Bootstrap to recreate <a href="http://unicurd.com.sg/" target="_blank">Unicurd homepage</a>. Everything was done in Replit before imported to GitHub

## Design Process

The website is created to fulfil a module requirement from Ngee Ann Polytechnic programme. This project will showcase my proficiency in utilising HTML and Bootstrap

I used Figma to create a mid-fi wireframe. The link is <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/kZQazxQ8afEZq8BfE676Ye/unicurd" target="_blank">here</a>
